    <h3>Interactive Design 1 - Spring 2017</h3>
    <p>In this class, I hope to learn code so I can be able to make my own website. I've heard it is important for designers to have their own website to be ahead in the game and I think it would just be cool to have one. I will most likely make more than one when I learn the skill because I would like to have a personal website also.</p>
    <p>Here's a list of the exercises and projects I've completed in this class:</p>

<h4>About me</h4>
<p>My path to becoming a designer is 
After I graduate from TCC I plan to transfer to a university, hopefully VCU.I heard they have a great art program. I've been an aristic person for as long as I can remember. One day my cousin mentioned I should try to do graphic design and I didn't know what that was so after doing some research I decided it was the career choce for me.I never knew I could be creative and make a career out of it. It seemed like a good idea to take some graphic design classes.</p>
<p>My aspirations as a designer are to be able to work from home because I want to have a flexible schedule and be able to spend a lot of time with and properly take care of my pets. I want to have a lot of them. I dislike the idea of having a nine to five job so I would like to avoid that if I can but I wouldn't mind having a desk job so much if I really had to do it. I mostly want to love what I do.</p>
<h5>I wrote all my own code!</h5>
