    <h2>Alex Packard</h2>
    <h3>Interactive Design 1 - Spring 2017</h3>
    <p>In this class, I hope to learn code so I can be able to make my own website. I've heard it is important for designers to have their own website to be ahead in the game and I think it would just be cool to have one. I will most likely make more than one when I learn the skill because I would like to have a personal website also.</p>
    <p>Here's a list of the exercises and projects I've completed in this class:</p>
