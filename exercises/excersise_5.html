                <ol>
                    <li>The adjectives I would describe her profile with would be creative, neat, clean, and clear.
                    </li>
                    <li>The design of the navigation is pretty creative. I really like how on the left side of her page she has the angel halo and the devil horns. I thought that was pretty cute since her last name is Heck. The pages she has on her profile are her about, her work, and her blog. </li>
                    <li>The design of the introductory information is bold and in your face. It really pops out at you and is different. What I've learned about Bethany is that she is playful and likes to have fun, but she is serious about her work. </li>
                    <li>The design and layout of the body content is nice and ordered so it looks easy to navigate the website.</li>
                    <li>The design of the footer is soft but noticable and fun.The information she includes here are her social media links and other websites. </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Mobile</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The navigation has changed by getting smaller and on the top right. The navigation has changed into three horizontal lines.</li>
                    <li>The size of the headline text has changed by getting a little bit smaller and taking up more of the page than before.</li>
                    <li>The size of the body text has changed by appearing bigger than before and it looks more smooshed together.</li>
                    <li>The layout of the content changed by there being less on the page that you can see at one time.</li>
                    <li>The layout of the footer changed by you not being able to see it right away, at least until you scroll down. The footer images are now stacked on top of one another.</li>
                </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>The layout of the website is very simple at first but when you get to interacting with it it's really cool.</li><li>The design of the website is very basic but it works well. Danilo indicates heirarchy by the different colors and placing certain words on top of one another.</li>
                <li>When changing to the Iphone 6 design the colors dont change when you hover over a word like they do on the desktop version. You have to just click on the link.</li>
