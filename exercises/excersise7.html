    <h1>Excersise 7: Website Analysis</h1>
    <h2>96 Elephants</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The adjectives I would use to design the site would be bleak, dreary, and depressing</li>
            <li>The navigation for the story works because it transpors you to a completely different page and I think that's a more effective way than scrolling. The visual cues to go on to the next chapter are the bright red links that change color. 
                I don't feel lost while browsing this story because of the visual cures and hierarchy.
            </li>
    
       
            <li>The ending for chapter 3 differs from the endings of the other 2 chapters because it has all the links and the footers included.
            </li>
     
            <li>I think the creaters of this site hoped to raise awareness of what is happening to these animals before it's too late. A lot of animals are becoming quickly extinct.</li>
        </ol>
            <h2>Elizabeth River Trail</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The adjectives I would use to describe the design of this site would be</li>
                    
                    <li>The navigation is a few links at the top right side of the page.
                        The pages that are in the navigation are a map of the trail, the history, and the future of it.
                        I don't really feel like lost browsing the site, when I first did  for like the first 3 seconds I was a little confused but I got used to it quickly.
                </li>
                    <li>The page names in the navigation seem approprate for the content on these pages because they show you exactly what they say.
                </li>
                <li>I think the creators of this site hoped to give the public a little information about the trail so maybe they will appreciate it more.
                </li>
