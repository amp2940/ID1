        The sections are separated usually by the different colors used. The change of color is drastic cause the colors used are so bright.
        <li>Question 4</li>
        Article is used in the Speakers section by representing a self-contained photo on the speaker on the page.
        <li>Question 5</li>
        The footer is laid out by the change of color to white.
        <li>Question 6</li>
        The navigation content differs from the footer content because some of the footer content is in bubbles (like the links) and it's just organized differently.
