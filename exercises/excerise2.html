     <h1>Magical Cloudz Website Analysis</h1>
    <ol>
        <!---------------Question 1--------------->
        <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
        <p>The pull quote font is pretty neat and easy to read. It is a kind of tall font that I think guides your eye down the site. The body text is also very neat and easy to read. It is a refreshing break away from Times New Roman or Helvetica but it is still very classy. It is also gothic, moody, and serious.</p>
        <!---------------Question2--------------->
        <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
        <p>The colors used are very muted and not too bright. The colors are used mostly behind text and in the pictures besides that the background of the site is white and color of the font is black. There is a maroon colored text box as soon as you scroll down the page.</p>
        <!---------------Question 3------------->
        <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
        <p>I feel like the visuals are used to break up the text because otherwise there would just be a wall of text and nobody likes looking at that. The visuals are used whenever there is a long body of text. The images are there to show the many sides of the main singer.</p>
        <!---------------Question 4------------->
        <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
        <p>The sections are separated by the pictures. The visual cues are when a paragraph ends and an image is shown. An image is usually shown after a couple of paragraphs.</p>
