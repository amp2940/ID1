        <h1>The State of the World</h1>
        <p>What I love about the state of the world is that we are so technologically advanced these days.</p>
        <p>What I hate about the state of the world today is that we have so much violence.</p>
        <p>What I wish I could change about the world is that would should have more peace and understanding.</p>
