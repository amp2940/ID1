        <h4>Vaccinations and Fixing</h4>
        <h5>Core and non-core vaccines:</h5>
        <p>Vaccines can be divided into core vaccines and non-core vaccines. The core vaccines are considered essential for all cats (including indoor-only cats) because of the widespread and/or severe nature of the diseases being protected against. Non-core vaccines are only given to cats if there is genuine risk of exposure to the infection and if vaccination would provide good protection. Decisions regarding requirement for non-core vaccines may be based on the catâ€™s age, lifestyle and contact with other cats. You should always discuss with your vet what vaccines your own cat may require.</p>
