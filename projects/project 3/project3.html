        <h3>Vaccinations and Fixing</h3>
        <h5>Core and non-core vaccines:</h5>
        <p>Vaccines can be divided into core vaccines and non-core vaccines. The core vaccines are considered essential for all cats (including indoor-only cats) because of the widespread and/or severe nature of the diseases being protected against. Non-core vaccines are only given to cats if there is genuine risk of exposure to the infection and if vaccination would provide good protection. Decisions regarding requirement for non-core vaccines may be based on the cat's age, lifestyle and contact with other cats. You should always discuss with your vet what vaccines your own cat may require.</p>

<h3>Indoor or Outdoor Cat?
        </h3>        
This is a tough decision for some cat owners to make. You will have to decide if you want your cat to stay safe indoors all it's life or if you want to allow your cat to roam the streets to its pleasure.
