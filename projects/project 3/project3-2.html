        <h3>Learning Your Cat's Personality</h3>
        <p>Like people all cats have their own unique personality. You need to make sure you have a good understanding of what your cat's personality is like so you can 
        </p>
<p>Genetics</p>
<p>It is only possible to fully know the genetics of pure-bred cats. Various cat breeds have been around long enough that their distinguishing characteristics such as body type and personalities are fairly consistent. Since cat breeders have made efforts to breed to type, colors within the breeds have also been consistent, according to breed standards. It is an interesting aside that colors in cats sometimes carry personality traits too. All in all, personalities within a given breed remain fairly consistent, other factors aside. As an example, the Cat Fanciers Association Persian Cat Profile describes its personality as "sweet", "gentle," and needing "an atmosphere of security and serenity," "but with love and reassurance, can easily adapt to the most boisterous of households."</p>
<p>Environment</p>
<p>Since the vast majority of pet cats are of the domestic or mixed breed variety, environment is the single most important factor behind their personalities.</p>
<p>Factors in the Environments of Homes With Cats</p>

<p>The single most important environmental factor for cats in their home is "What is the overall mood of the home?" A home where the human family members' interaction is normally on an even keel, whether it be quiet and harmonious or noisy and happily active, is the most desirable atmosphere for cats. One of the things cats hate the most is change of any kind, and that includes changes in attitudes from day to day. If the humans are happy and active one minute, moody and distant the next, and perhaps arguing loudly the next, the cats will reflect these changes according to their own personalities. A shy, withdrawn cat may hide under the bed for days. A normally active, gregarious cat may suddenly turn on his favorite feline housemate - sort of a variation on the redirected aggression syndrome.</p>
<p>History
<p>A cat's history plays a large role in his or her personality, as well as behavior. With most purebred cats obtained from a cattery, a complete pedigree going back several generations will be part of the purchase price. However, history is not just a pedigree. Certainly, a "purebred cat" purchased from a backyard breeder (kitten mill) will have a much different personality than a cat raised "underfoot" in a reputable breeder's home.
However, with domestic cats, many of whom may have been found on the street, or adopted from animal shelters, often very little is known or revealed, of the cat's history. A cat may have been in an abusive situation. He may have been loved by someone in his previous family, but someone else decided to get a dog, and the cat had to go. Or the previous owners may have been evicted from their rentals, or foreclosed by the lender. In the latter cases, it is not unusual for them simply to leave the cat behind, or drop him off at the shelter.</p>

        <h3>Care Basics</h3>
<p>Encourage the cat to use a litter box.</p>
<p>Make the litter box a comfortable place.</p>
<p>Take young or old cats needs into consideration.</p>
<p>Provide the cat with a scratching post.</p>
<p>Discourage the cat from exploring forbidden surfaces.</p>
<p>Consider using feline pheromone products.</p>

        
        <h4>Stimulation</h4>
<p>Cats can and will get bored. You'll need to find a way to stimulate them.</p>
<p>With a little creativity, you can keep your cat stimulated and interested, even in a small apartment and on a limited budget. And the good news is that enrichment research has shown that toys that are removed and then returned after several weeks regain much of their novelty; extend your enrichment budget by rotating your cat's toys regularly. Get started with a few of these feline friendly activities, but begin slowly and be sure to get a thumbs up from kitty's veterinarian.</p>

<p>Foraging Fun</p>
<p>Separate each day's food rations into small batches. Place the clusters around the house and then toss a few small treats in random directions. Not only will this encourage active foraging, it'll also keep kitty from scarfing down her food too quickly.<p>

<p>Pleasurable Puzzles</p>
   <p>Toss a few treats into a square Rubbermaid bottle and leave it on the floor with the lid off for a great beginner puzzle.</p>

<p>Any plastic container with a secure lid can become a hanging puzzle. Just cut two or three slots around the bottom outer edge of the container and place a few treats in the center. String a cord through the lid and hang this puzzle over a doorknob. Once your cat gets the hang of it, you can encourage exercise by raising it higher.</p>
