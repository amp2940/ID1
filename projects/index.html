        <p>My favorite band would have to be Gorillaz because I really love their music and how they really experiment with a lot of different sounds and genres to come up with something really unique. I also really love the fact that they are animated. It just adds something really cool to the whole music scene. The whole concept of the band is to “reject false icons”. They want you to be able to enjoy the music without being blinded by the pop culture aspect of most bands, that’s why they chose to not show their faces and just have animated characters singing and playing the instruments. They just released a new single after six years of not making any music.</p>
        <p>Gorillaz are a British virtual band made in 1998 by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. The band comprises of four animated characters: 2D (lead vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar, vocals), Noodle (guitar, keyboard, and backup vocals) and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). These characters are totally anecdotal and are not personas of any "genuine living" performers required in the project. Their anecdotal universe is shown through the band's site and music recordings, and in addition various other media, for example, a few short, one minute cartoons. As a general rule, Albarn is the main musical coordinater, and the music is regularly a combined effort between different performers. Journalists and commentators have depicted their music as alternative rock, Britpop, trip hop, hip hop, electronica, non-mainstream, reggae and pop.</p>
        <p>The band's 2001 presentation collection Gorillaz sold more than seven million duplicates and earned them a passage in the Guinness Book of World Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. They were designated for the Mercury Prize in 2001, yet the assignment was later pulled back at the band's request. Their second studio collection, Demon Days, which was released in 2005, went five times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US.
